	<p align="justify">In 1947, on 15th August, India became independent. We won freedom from British Raj after a hard struggle. On this day at the stroke of midnight, Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru, our first Prime Minister, unfurled the National Flag at the Red Fort for the first time. It marked the end of the 200 years old British reign in India. We now breathe air in a free and sovereign nation.

The British have governed India for about 200 years. Under British colonisation, the life of every Indian was dismal and full of struggle. Indians were treated as slaves and had no freedom of speech. Indian rulers were puppets in the possession of British officers. Indian fighters were dealt with cruelty in British camps, and farmers were starving as they couldn't grow crops and needed to pay substantial land taxes.

On this special occasion, the people of India remember the selfless sacrifices and unparalleled contributions of great men and women to achieve the independence of India. Leaders like Mahatma Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Subhas Chandra Bose, Maulana Abdul Kalam Azad, Sardar Patel, and Gopalbandhu Das are paid reverent homage by one and all in the country.</p>
<h3 id="Great-of-freedom-fighters">Great of freedom fighters</h3>
<p align="justify">India couldn't have acquired independence without the efforts of numerous extraordinary freedom fighters. Bhagat Singh, Rani of Jhansi, Chandra Shekhar Azad, Subhas Chandra Bose, Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi, Jawaharlal Nehru, Ram Prasad Bismil, and Ashfaqulla Khan are some of the notable names.</p>

<p align="justify">Not all the British were awful; many started adoring India and did incredible things for it. Some even took part in the Indian Independence struggle. Some of the good British rulers include Warren Hastings who developed court reforms; Freda Bedi who supported Indian nationalism; Allan Octavian Hume who started the Indian National Congress, etc.</p>
<h3 id="Celebrate-Indian-Independence-Day">Celebrate Indian Independence Day</h3>
<p align="justify">India accomplished freedom following a 200-year-long battle. India gained complete independence from the British on 15th August 1947. That is why the day holds importance in the heart of each Indian citizen either living in India or abroad. India is celebrating 76 years of freedom on 15th August 2023 as Azadi Ka Amrit Mahotsav. This day also helps us remember the struggles of freedom fighters and the lives sacrificed in attaining independence.

The struggle that our freedom fighters have gone through shows us that the freedom we appreciate today has been attained by shedding the blood of hundreds of individuals. It stirs patriotism inside each Indian. It makes the current generation understand the struggles of individuals around them and familiarise themselves with the freedom fighters of India.</p>
